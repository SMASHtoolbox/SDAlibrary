This directory contains MATLAB support for Sanda Data Archive (*.sda) files.  Adding this directory to the MATLAB path provides the functions "probeSDA", "readSDA", and "writeSDA".  The SDAbrowser program is a graphical front end to these functions.

A subset of the SMASH (Sandia Matlab AnalysiS Hierarchy) toolbox is included in this directory.  Functions and classes defined within +SMASH package can be called directly, but standard users should stick with the probe/read/write functions and SDAbrowser program.
