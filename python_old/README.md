# pysda
The purpose of this library is to provide users with
tools to read from and write to hdf5 files while maintaining
the Sandia Data Archive format restrictions. The user is not
limited from straying from this format, but cannot do so without
accessing the h5py library. In most use cases, this should not
be done.
Furthermore, this package supplies ways to write and access data.
The user is free to interpret that data in any way they wish.
